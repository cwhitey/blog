Ghost is an opensource blogging platform which is [highly configurable with themes](http://marketplace.ghost.org/). You can download and run it yourself, or alternatively use their own hosting service which requires payment after the free trial period. You can use Buster to turn your blog into a static site, and deploy it directly to your GitHub Page.\n\n#### Setup\n1. Make your own GitHub Pages repo as described [here](https://pages.github.com/), although you'll need to leave it empty for Buster to work.\n2. Make sure you have [NodeJS and NPM installed](http://nodejs.org/download/).\n3. Download and unzip Ghost [here](https://ghost.org/download/). In this directory, run:\n \n\t    npm install --production\n        npm start\n\n\t Ghost should start up on http://localhost:2368.\n4. Go to http://localhost:2368/ghost/ and enter you information into the forms to get to the admin panel. From here you can publish blog posts, edit your blog information, select different themes, and edit your user profile.\n5. Install PIP [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) and follow the directions. \n6. Run: \n \n        buster setup --gh-repo='your GitHub Pages repo URL'\n        buster generate --domain=localhost:2368\n        buster deploy\n\nWell done! Your blog should now be pushed to your GitHub Pages repo, and will be live at http://username.github.io shortly. Be patient. The first deployment always takes the longest, and could take up to 40 minutes. I've also had other updates take over 10 minutes to be reflected in production.\nNew themes must go into ````Ghost-root/content/themes/````, and if you'd like to like to play around with making your own theme or edit an existing theme from the marketplace, Ghost have a [very good guide](http://themes.ghost.org/). The theme used for this blog can be found [here](https://github.com/cwhitey/crisp-ghost-theme).\n\n#### Issues\nI keep my entire ghost source in a separate GitHub repo so I can make blog changes from any machine configured with nodejs and Buster. However, when doing a ````buster deploy```` from a different machine, I often get the following error:\n\n\n```bash\n...\nerror: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/cwhitey/cwhitey.github.io.git'\nhint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do\nhint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing\nhint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes\nhint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\nhint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\n```\n\nTo get it deployed I've had to copy the contents of the ````static/```` directory populated by the ````buster generate```` into my GitHub Pages repo, then push it manually:\n    \n```bash    \ngit add --all\ngit commit -m \"your message\"\ngit push -f\n```\n\nAs you will be doing this entire process regularly, you may decide to just write a single script to do it for you.

Oh-my-emacs provides you with a completely documented starting setup which benefits both beginners and experts of Emacs. It's configuration is contained within <code>.org</code> files which contains Emacs Lisp code within <code>#+BEGIN_SRC</code> and <code>#+END_SRC</code> tags. The <code>.org</code> files get parsed into <code>.el</code> files during Emacs initialisation, and you can prevent snippets of Emacs Lisp code from being parsed by changing <code>#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp</code> to <code>#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no</code>.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"installation\">Installation:</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mac: <a href=\"https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port\">Emacs Mac port</a></li>\n<li>Linux: Your Linux distro's package manager will likely contain Emacs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"setup\">Setup:</h5>\n\n<p>Install oh-my-emacs by following these <a href=\"https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs#quick-start\">Quick Start steps</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"thefollowingrequiresupdates\">The following requires updates...</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"configuration\">Configuration:</h5>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Add melpa archives</p>\n\n<pre><code>(add-to-list 'package-archives\n             '(\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/\"))\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Mac user keys</p>\n\n<pre><code>(global-set-key (kbd \"M-c\") 'copy-region-as-kill)\n(global-set-key (kbd \"M-v\") 'yank)\n(global-set-key (kbd \"M-z\") 'undo)\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NeoTree\">NeoTree</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>(global-set-key [f8] 'neotree-toggle)\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WindMove\">WindMove</a> </p>\n\n<pre><code>(when (fboundp 'windmove-default-keybindings)\n      (windmove-default-keybindings 'alt))\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Undo an undo</p>\n\n<pre><code>(global-set-key (kbd \"C-S-/\") 'undo-tree-redo)\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Fullscreen a frame</p>\n\n<pre><code>(global-set-key (kbd \"C-c m\") 'toggle-frame-maximized)\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1418457425790,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1421235718671,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1418612092435,"published_by":1},{"id":7,"uuid":"37d00d1d-0d01-4c89-9ec5-a5e70b522eda","title":"Choosing a Clojure web template","slug":"choosing-a-clojure-web-template","markdown":"I recently started a small pet project which will run as a web application with backend support.
